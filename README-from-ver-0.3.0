If you want to add a nation, add record in file /etc/Nations.txt.
I used the ISTAT table of the "Stati esteri" (http://www.istat.it/it/files/2011/01/CodiciStati2014.xls)
but however, you can change the encoding of the nations.

If you want to add a mobile phone operator, add record in file
/etc/Operators_Mobile_Parameters.txt
/etc/Operators_Mobile.txt

If you want to add a router, add record in file
/etc/RouterIPAddressesName.txt
/etc/RouterIPAddresses.txt

If you want to add a custom router of an ISP (Internet Service 
Provider), add record in file
/etc/RouterOperatorsIPAddressesName.txt
/etc/RouterOperatorsIPAddresses.txt
